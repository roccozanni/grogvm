# GrogVM — Progress

Lean tracker. Two buckets:

- **Current** — what's in flight and what's open right now. This is also the
  **lab notebook**: capture each concrete finding as it happens — root causes,
  exact opcode numbers, semantics, the *why* — because this is the source
  material the end-of-phase doc update is written from. Don't reconstruct doc
  prose from memory later; that's how bad claims get in. A finding stays here
  until it has been written into the right `pages/docs/` file — only then trim it.
- **Next** — the work ahead, as one-liners. Broken into tasks only when we start.

## Current — natural play through MI1

Playing MI1 from the start and fixing each blocker as it's hit (engine-faithful,
committed on `main`). **Unit suite green + tsc clean**, plus a data-gated
integration playthrough (`npm run test:integration`). The intro → room 33 →
SCUMM Bar (room 28) → pirate-conversation close-up is playable end-to-end, with
verbs, inventory, and two-object "Usa X con Y" / "Dai X a Y" working.

**Working principle (agreed 2026-06-02):** no hacks/shortcuts — every change is
the final, SCUMM-faithful solution. Confirm the real mechanism first (disassemble
the original, check ScummVM semantics) before editing; when engine-faithful and a
quick shell workaround disagree, faithful wins. Verify the actual outcome (render
real pixels for visual bugs; reproduce the real flow for behaviour) — not the
bookkeeping. Surface any deferral/approximation explicitly and track it here;
never bury a shortcut. If "faithful" needs a bigger refactor, raise the tradeoff
rather than silently taking either the heavy path or the shortcut.

**In flight — MI1 full walkthrough (the regression net), started 2026-06-04.**
`integration/mi1/walkthrough.test.ts`: ONE seeded VM driven through the game's
own solution start→onward, grown beat by beat (last green beat = the frontier);
run end-of-session / after a refactor. Design + the testkit pieces it added
(`actions.ts` faithful action vocabulary, `random.ts` seeded-RNG seam,
`beat()` guard, headless/from-boot/deterministic rationale) →
[AGENTS "The harness"](AGENTS.md). Engine finding — *a printing sentence blocks
the next one* (command mid-speech no-ops; wait for the line to clear) →
[INPUT §5](pages/docs/scumm/input.md). The beats carry **zero `driveTicks`**:
each `use`/`walkTo`/`give` first waits on `waitReady` (control back + ego
stopped + no line/cutscene — the one condition all the old magic-number
"settles" were approximating), and outcomes are asserted with named
condition-waiters beside `driveToRoom` — `waitPickedUp` (ego owns an object),
`waitGlobal` (a story flag/counter hits a value), `waitPlayable` (control +
verb bar back) — falling back to a raw `driveUntil` only for bespoke predicates
(cook sweep, gull bolt, staged crossings) and to the real signal for genuine
event-waits (e.g. the dock door's state flipping to open, `vm.objectStates`).
So beats read as a plain action sequence, and comments are pruned to only what
explains a game mechanic / puzzle (the cook window, the room-52 high/low guard,
the cannon-gag auto-return, the store-door open-handler quirk, …) — the helper
calls speak for themselves. Old `playthrough.test.ts` deleted (its
mechanics are now the first five beats). The final beat snapshots the end state
to `saves/MI1-walkthrough-frontier.websave.json` (gitignored, regenerated every
green run so it can't drift): the net itself always runs from boot, but the *next*
beat can be developed by `restoreSave`-ing the frontier instead of re-driving the
whole game — the buggy `Italiano-2-post-fettuccini` save is **not** trustworthy
(broken actor scale from the `ignoreBoxes` bug), so generate from the run.

Beats are named `<Part> · <Room> — <what it proves>` (Part = the game's own
part; I = "The Three Trials"), **no ordinal** — file order *is* run order.
Per-game ids/vars live in `game.ts`: `ROOMS` (room-grouped objects/scripts),
`VERBS`, and `VARS` (story/puzzle globals — assert these over localized text).

Frontier (all Part I): **Mêlée Lookout** boot→33, floor-walk, look-at poster,
open+walk the bar door→28 → **SCUMM Bar** LOOM-ad pirate close-up (talk #333 →
room 82, answer #121/goodbye #124); three important-looking pirates (#322, inline
conv #220, answer #122/goodbye #127) → trials learned (`VARS.trialsLearned`/g197
0→1); wait out the cook (actor #6, ~2000t hidden / ~800t out wandering) and walk
the open kitchen door (#316→41 — a *verb-11 sentence* on the door, since a bare
floor click won't run its walk-through script) → **Kitchen** take meat #566 + pot
#567; stomp the loose board #575 3× to scare the seagull (actor #7) — fish #568 is
grabbable only DURING the fly-away (its class-6 "the bird will peck" guard lifts
only mid-flight), keyed off `VARS.gullScare`/g272 → retrace out (kitchen door
#570→bar, exit door #315→lookout, one-time Sheriff cutscene 70→72) → **Mêlée
Lookout** walk west off the cliff (#426→38) → **cliff path** take the path
(#487, verbs [90,255] → walk-11 falls back to the 0xFF/255 default) → **Mêlée
map** (85, verb-11 location nodes) click the clearing (#912→52) → **clearing**
walk to the circus tent (#621→51) → **Fettucini circus** break into the
brothers' auto-argument (local #207) with "ahem", negotiate the cannonball job
(answer ids are `120 + optionIndex-1`, so 120 recurs per menu — sequence by
speech), **give the pot as the helmet** (Give/verb-4 *to actor 3* — the first
give-to-actor; sets `bit#103` → cannon launch → amnesia gag → payout) and get
paid **478 pieces of eight** (`VARS.money`/g195 0→478, object #488 verb-250).
The room-52 clearing crossing is staged (descend to the low zone first — local
script 202's high/low guard, not a routing workaround; see Pathfinding) →
**back to the Mêlée town** (one grouped travel beat): circus exit #617→52, climb
back to the high zone, path #622→map, the map's *village* node #917 (its verb-11
branches on g196 — still 0 this early, so it lands in the wide lookout/town room
33, not the docks 83), then room-33 east arch #427→**Mêlée town street 35** →
**buy the treasure map** off citizen #441 (an *object*, talk #218; the cousin-
Dominique opener #123 then "take it" #121 → map #442 to ego, g195 478→378) →
**Voodoo Lady 29** (open+walk door #444, pocket the rubber chicken #377, back out
#367) → **general store** (arch #451→street 34, then the store door #437 — its
open handler only takes with ego *standing at it*, so approach→open→enter, unlike
the bar/voodoo doors) → **buy the sword #388 + shovel #396** (grab both off the
shelf first, then ring the bell — Push/verb-5 #399 — and settle up with shopkeeper
#394: buy menu reuses ids, sequence `aboutSword 120 → wantIt 120 → aboutShovel
121 → wantIt 120 → lookAround 125`; g195 378→203) → exit #387 back to street 34.
Next: the three trials proper — swordfighting (the *house* map node → Captain
Smirk → fight pirates for insults → the Sword Master node #918), thievery, treasure.

### Open bug-report saves (reported, not yet fixed)

- *(none open — the room-28 cook is fixed; see the finding below.)*

**Engine finding — `followBoxes`/`ignoreBoxes` reset `_forceClip` (fixes the
room-28 cook behind the table; user-confirmed in-browser 2026-06-07).** The
cook (actor 6) wasn't a routing or compositor-occlusion bug at all. Its patrol
(room 28 local #216) restores box-driven depth with `{followBoxes}` and *never*
issues `neverZclip`, but ENCD had left it at `alwaysZclip=1`. Our `followBoxes`
(opcodes/index.ts subop 0x15) only cleared `ignoreBoxes`, so `forceClip` stayed
pinned at 1 and `resolveClipPlane` short-circuited (`forceClip > 0` wins before
any box lookup) → the cook was masked by ZP01 (the table) for its whole sweep.
Fix: `followBoxes` now also sets `forceClip = 0` (the "not forced" sentinel);
live state confirms the cook runs `forceClip=0` (box-driven) across the wander,
snapping back to 1 only at the x≈600–660 entry/exit where the script explicitly
sets `{ignoreBoxes; alwaysZclip=1}`. `ignoreBoxes` (subop 0x14) was made
symmetric (SCUMM resets `_forceClip` there too); provably a no-op for all
current MI1 play since every on-path `ignoreBoxes` pairs with a trailing
explicit clip op that wins — it only gives a bare `{ignoreBoxes}` a defined
state instead of a stale `alwaysZclip`. → document in [ZPLANE]
(pages/docs/scumm/zplane.md) at the next doc pass.

**Engine finding — actor `_walkbox` is now tracked walk-state, not a draw-time
lookup (user-confirmed in-browser 2026-06-07).** A review flagged that
`resolveClipPlane` (and the scale system, and `getActorWalkBox`) re-derived the
actor's box from pixel position every frame via `findBoxAtOrNearest(x,y)`,
where SCUMM stores `_walkbox` and maintains it as the actor moves. Landed the
faithful model: `actor.walkBox` is set in `rescaleActorForPosition` (the single
movement/placement seam), reset to `-1` by `initActor`, retained while
`ignoreBoxes` (so an airborne actor keeps its last box, `-1` → front), read by
the compositor and `getActorWalkBox`. The old `if (actor.ignoreBoxes) return 0`
escape hatch in `resolveClipPlane` is gone (the `-1`-on-init sentinel covers the
room-51 cannon-launch case it existed for). It was **behaviour-neutral for
current MI1 play** (a normal walker's `walkBox` tracks position each tick, so it
matches the old lookup) — confirmed in-browser: cook crossing the bar OK,
Fettucini cannon gag OK. Kept for faithfulness, not a visible fix. Does NOT
include the *line-following walker* (`stepWalk` still steps X/Y independently);
that half of the old backlog item stays open.

### Tier-2 divergence checklist

Silent, self-flagged approximations (run `git grep -nE "for now|doesn't yet|best-effort|we don't yet"`
to refresh). Tiering: **Tier 1** = loud (halts on unknown opcode — fine). **Tier 2**
= these (silent until a script ordering makes them observable, like the EXCD bug).
**Tier 3** = unknown unknowns (only ScummVM differential tracing finds them).

Priority H/M/L = likelihood of biting current/near play × severity.

- [ ] **M — all-1s object z-plane drop is a TENTATIVE HACK**
  (`object/loader.ts decodeObjectZPlanes`): a fully-set object z-plane is
  dropped so it never occludes. Keys on the only signal separating occluders
  from non-occluders in MI1 (object masks are bimodal — shaped <95% vs solid
  100%; the 36 solid ones — forest path trunks, store door, levers, vase — are
  all non-occluders) but it is **not** a confirmed engine rule: we never found
  *why* the original ignores a solid object mask. Ruled out (don't re-chase):
  object class (incl. class-32 = clickability), `ZP0k → plane k` index,
  name-vs-order indexing, stubbed/buggy room script, walk-box clip plane, image
  transparency (trunks are opaque color-0). Answer lives in the original's
  object-mask write path (not on this machine). **Suspect this FIRST for any
  object-occlusion bug — don't run the circles again.** → [ZPLANE].
  *Also ruled out (2026-06-07): the ZP **decoder** (a review's "data_size
  prefix / +2 strip-offset shift" theory — false for V5; the offset table is at
  payload[0], the trunk genuinely decodes all-1s). And dropping the hack does
  NOT become safe once `_walkbox` is tracked: removed it as an experiment with
  the walkbox change in — forest-path trunks then occlude ego (confirmed
  in-browser), so the hack stays until a new theory for the write path.*
- [ ] **M — dialog/string escape codes still deferred**
  (`decodeScummString` / `expandSubstitution`, `opcodes/index.ts:~2155`):
  keep-text `0xFF02`, sound `0xFF09`, actor-name `0xFF0A`, mid-string colour
  `0xFF0E` (each consumed but emits nothing). Surfaces as blank/wrong text or
  missing inline colour in dialogue-heavy content. (Also in Stubbed opcodes
  below.) *Done since last review:* `0x04` int, `0x05` verb-name, `0x06`
  object/actor-name, `0x07` string-resource all expand now.
- [ ] **L/M — `print` `clipped` line-wrap bound not modelled** (`vm.ts:~524`).
  Long lines may overflow / mis-wrap vs the original's clip-X wrapping.
- [ ] **L — system `print` text clears on cutscene-end / room-change / overwrite,
  not the talk timer** (`vm.ts advanceOrEndTalk` + `endCutscene`). Faithful for
  the known cases (treasure-map close-up room 63 prints the dance steps then
  waits for a *click* → text must persist; the cook's "Non puoi venire di qui!"
  clears at its `endCutScene`). The talk timer still only governs actor speech +
  `VAR_HAVE_MSG`. Regression surface: a non-keepText system `print` during *free
  gameplay* (no following cutscene-end/room-change/print) would now linger; none
  in the walkthrough net, but not exhaustively ruled out. SCUMM's real eraser is
  `restoreCharsetBg` (screen redraw), which we approximate with those triggers.
- [ ] **L — camera scroll "snap both for now"** (`opcodes/index.ts:~411`) +
  smooth `panCameraTo` (Open backlog). Gradual scroll over frames; no current
  scene validates it.
- [ ] **L — flashlight gfx not modelled** (`opcodes/index.ts:~577`, dark-room
  strip extent). Cosmetic; only the flashlight rooms.
- [ ] **? — `actorOps` subop `0x0f` treated as no-arg no-op "for now"**
  (`opcodes/index.ts:~1874`; seen in MI1 boot after setCostume, not in the
  wiki). Assess whether it affects behaviour or is genuinely inert.
- Already tracked elsewhere (cross-ref, not duplicated here): line-following
  walker (Pathfinding backlog), `screenEffect` animation + `VAR_CURRENT_LIGHTS`
  darkening (Rendering backlog), `saveRestoreVerbs` subset (Watch-for), audio /
  `resourceRoutines` (Out of scope — Phase 11).

**Watch for** (recurring failure modes in newly-reached content):

- Unimplemented opcodes → an unknown-opcode halt freezes the *whole* VM.
- Object states beyond the initial `DOBJ` seed (only initial owner/state/class
  is parsed). See [OBJECTS §7a](pages/docs/scumm/objects.md).
- `saveRestoreVerbs`: we render-skip archived verbs (a subset of SCUMM's
  per-verb `saveid` model); revisit if a scene re-creates a saved verb id.
  See [INPUT §6](pages/docs/scumm/input.md).

**Tooling:** `scratch/dis.ts` (+ `SCAN grep=`) is the disassembler CLI — keep it
in sync with the executing opcode table (AGENTS.md).

### Open backlog

Deferred out of earlier phases; none block current play. Detail in the linked docs.

**Input / UI**

- **Inventory scroll arrows** (verbs 208/209) for >8 items — needs a full
  inventory to exercise.

**Rendering**

- **Unify the render surface — Phase A done; Phase B (engine-side) remaining.**
  Phase A (done): the room slice and the verb/inventory panel now share ONE
  visible canvas. The engine compositor presents the room into the renderer's
  *offscreen* canvas; the shell blits it into the top rows of the screen canvas
  and paints the verb panel + overlays below/over it. A single `mountScreenInput`
  drives the lot in unified screen coords (true screen position → VARs 44/45,
  room coords → 20/21), so the cursor glides continuously from the room into the
  inventory and #23 sees the inventory band natively — the dual-write coordinate
  bridge is gone. Phase B (the fully faithful end-state, deferred): move the
  verb-panel rendering *into* the engine compositor so it emits the whole 320×200
  framebuffer with 1:1 coords (the sentence line is already engine verb #100,
  assembled from `0xFF NN` substitution codes). All of Phase A's canvas / input /
  cursor plumbing is reused unchanged — only the verb-pixel source swaps. Take it
  on when a *render-side* reason appears (mid-string dialogue colours `0x0E`, the
  copy-protection wheel) — not speculatively.
- **Compositor honours `VAR_CURRENT_LIGHTS`** — darken a night room via the
  lights flag, not only a dark palette (may be subtle; night rooms already ship
  dark palettes — check it's visible first). [LIGHTING §4](pages/docs/scumm/lighting.md).
- **`screenEffect` transition animation** — state is modelled; the
  dissolve/scroll/instant *animation* is deferred (intro is all instant cuts).
  [SCREEN-EFFECT](pages/docs/scumm/screen-effect.md).
- **Palette cycling (`CYCL`) not animated** — the room's `CYCL` block is
  catalogued but the engine doesn't cycle the palette ranges, so animated
  palette effects (water shimmer, etc.) are static. No intro-path room depends
  on it; wire it when a scene surfaces. [ROOM](pages/docs/scumm/room.md).
- **Smooth `panCameraTo`** — snaps today; no intro-reachable scene uses it, so
  the pan rate has no validation target. Wire it when a scene surfaces.
- **Costume head-limb facing — remaining edges.** The head limb is re-pointed on
  the walk→stop transition (shipped 2026-05-31). Not yet handled: a *turn in
  place while idle* (a script changing `facing` with no walk) — the head keeps
  its last init-set frame; wire the same init-re-point on any at-rest facing
  change when a scene surfaces it. Two scene-specific symptoms noted earlier and
  **not since re-confirmed** (verify before chasing): a room-33 cliff N/S facing
  flip-flop (likely a walk direction-picker issue, separate from the head) and a
  room-38 entry head-loss transient. See [COSTUME-ANIM](pages/docs/scumm/costume-anim.md).

**Pathfinding**

- **Line-following walker (`calcMovementFactor`) — the faithful follow-up,
  deferred.** `stepWalk` steps X/Y independently; SCUMM moves along the line.
  Without this, thin diagonal connector boxes are fragile (actor drifts off) —
  the room-52 single-click bridge crossing is the live symptom (staged in the
  walkthrough). Touches every walk + the stepWalk unit tests (which encode the
  current independent-step behaviour) → re-verify intro/bar/kitchen + render.
  [PATHFINDING §9](pages/docs/engine/pathfinding.md). *(The walk-box-as-state
  half — tracking `_walkbox` instead of re-deriving it at draw time — is DONE;
  see the finding above.)*

**Stubbed opcodes (cosmetic / peripheral)**

- `roomOps`: `shakeOn`/`shakeOff`, `roomIntensity` / `setRGBRoomIntensity`,
  `saveString` / `loadString`.
- `cursorCommand` image subops (0x2C): `setCursorImage` / `setCursorHotspot` /
  `setCursor`.
- `matrixOp` (0x30): `setBoxScale` / `createBoxMatrix` no-ops (`setBoxFlags`
  is implemented — per-screen box locking).
- Dialog escape codes still deferred: keep-text `0x02`, sound `0x09`, actor
  name `0x0A`, mid-string colour `0x0E`. (`0x04`–`0x07` now expand — see the
  Tier-2 entry above.)

**Tooling**

- `disasm.ts` drifts past a non-print opcode mis-size on some scripts (e.g.
  global #178 tail) — chase only if a task needs that script.

### Out of scope (their own phases)

- **Audio** — sound opcodes stay silent stubs (`isSoundRunning → 0` lets
  sound-waits fall through). Fixes the "Le tre prove" ~5 s sound-gated hold for
  free. → Phase 11.
- **Resource-heap management** — `resourceRoutines` stay no-ops (resources load
  lazily; there's no managed heap to model).

---

## Next

Three items ahead, one of which — keep playing MI1 — is the Current section
above. We no longer track by phase number; ARCHITECTURE §9 keeps the historical
phase roadmap (and git matches it).

- **Audio** — iMUSE + AdLib first; MT-32 and CD redbook later.
- **MI2** — verify it boots on the same engine; fix the v5-but-slightly-different
  edge cases. Known unimplemented one: MI2 `COST` payloads need their first 2
  bytes skipped before parsing (every payload-relative offset is 2 bytes too
  small otherwise) — the costume decoder doesn't yet apply this shift.
