# GrogVM — Progress

Lean tracker. Three buckets:

- **Current** — what's in flight and what's open right now. This is also the
  **lab notebook**: capture each concrete finding as it happens — root causes,
  exact opcode numbers, semantics, the *why* — because this is the source
  material the end-of-phase doc update is written from. Don't reconstruct doc
  prose from memory later; that's how bad claims get in. A finding stays here
  until it has been written into the right `docs/` file — only then trim it.
- **Next phases** — one-liners. Broken into tasks only when we start them.
- **Done** — one or two lines per concluded phase. The durable knowledge lives
  in `docs/` and the code; git has the blow-by-blow. When a phase concludes,
  first migrate its findings from Current into the right `docs/` file, *then*
  shrink the entry here to a line or two.

## Current — natural play through MI1

Playing MI1 from the start and fixing each blocker as it's hit (engine-faithful,
committed on `main`). **827 unit tests + tsc clean**, plus a data-gated
integration playthrough (`npm run test:integration`). The intro → room 33 →
SCUMM Bar (room 28) → pirate-conversation close-up is playable end-to-end, with
verbs, inventory, and two-object "Usa X con Y" / "Dai X a Y" working.

**Working principle (agreed 2026-06-02):** no hacks/shortcuts — every change is
the final, SCUMM-faithful solution. Confirm the real mechanism first (disassemble
the original, check ScummVM semantics) before editing; when engine-faithful and a
quick shell workaround disagree, faithful wins. Verify the actual outcome (render
real pixels for visual bugs; reproduce the real flow for behaviour) — not the
bookkeeping. Surface any deferral/approximation explicitly and track it here;
never bury a shortcut. If "faithful" needs a bigger refactor, raise the tradeoff
rather than silently taking either the heavy path or the shortcut.

**In flight — MI1 full walkthrough (the regression net), started 2026-06-04.**
`integration/mi1/walkthrough.test.ts`: ONE seeded VM driven through the game's
own solution start→onward, grown beat by beat (last green beat = the frontier);
run end-of-session / after a refactor. Design + the testkit pieces it added
(`actions.ts` faithful action vocabulary, `random.ts` seeded-RNG seam,
`beat()` guard, headless/from-boot/deterministic rationale) →
[AGENTS "The harness"](AGENTS.md). Engine finding — *a printing sentence blocks
the next one* (command mid-speech no-ops; wait for the line to clear) →
[INPUT §5](docs/SCUMM-V5-INPUT.md). Old `playthrough.test.ts` deleted (its
mechanics are now the first five beats).

Beats are named `<Part> · <Room> — <what it proves>` (Part = the game's own
part; I = "The Three Trials"), **no ordinal** — file order *is* run order.
Per-game ids/vars live in `game.ts`: `ROOMS` (room-grouped objects/scripts),
`VERBS`, and `VARS` (story/puzzle globals — assert these over localized text).

Frontier (all Part I): **Mêlée Lookout** boot→33, floor-walk, look-at poster,
open+walk the bar door→28 → **SCUMM Bar** LOOM-ad pirate close-up (talk #333 →
room 82, answer #121/goodbye #124); three important-looking pirates (#322, inline
conv #220, answer #122/goodbye #127) → trials learned (`VARS.trialsLearned`/g197
0→1); wait out the cook (actor #6, ~2000t hidden / ~800t out wandering) and walk
the open kitchen door (#316→41 — a *verb-11 sentence* on the door, since a bare
floor click won't run its walk-through script) → **Kitchen** take meat #566 + pot
#567; stomp the loose board #575 3× to scare the seagull (actor #7) — fish #568 is
grabbable only DURING the fly-away (its class-6 "the bird will peck" guard lifts
only mid-flight), keyed off `VARS.gullScare`/g272 → retrace out (kitchen door
#570→bar, exit door #315→lookout, one-time Sheriff cutscene 70→72) → **Mêlée
Lookout** walk west off the cliff (#426→38) → **cliff path** take the path
(#487, verbs [90,255] → walk-11 falls back to the 0xFF/255 default) → **Mêlée
map** (85, verb-11 location nodes) click the clearing (#912→52) → **clearing**
walk to the circus tent (#621→51) → **Fettucini circus** break into the
brothers' auto-argument (local #207) with "ahem", negotiate the cannonball job
(answer ids are `120 + optionIndex-1`, so 120 recurs per menu — sequence by
speech), **give the pot as the helmet** (Give/verb-4 *to actor 3* — the first
give-to-actor; sets `bit#103` → cannon launch → amnesia gag → payout) and get
paid **478 pieces of eight** (`VARS.money`/g195 0→478, object #488 verb-250).
The room-52 clearing crossing is staged (descend to the low zone first — local
script 202's high/low guard, not a routing workaround; see Pathfinding).
Next: back to the map and the three trials (sword, thievery, treasure).

**Capability landed this session — headless actor hit-testing** (so the net can
click actors for Talk-to / Give-to-actor): `prepareActorDraw` is the shared
sprite-box source the compositor and `Vm.actorHitBounds` both use, with testkit
`actorPoint`/`pickDialogAnswer` on top. Dialog answer-verb scheme (`120 +
optionIndex−1`, g194, per-menu reuse) + give-to-actor → [INPUT §5](docs/SCUMM-V5-INPUT.md);
harness helpers → [AGENTS "The harness"](AGENTS.md). **Give X to <actor>**
(verb 4) now exercised end-to-end.

### Open bug-report saves (reported, not yet fixed)

- **Room 28 cook drawn behind the table (compositor, not pathfinding).**
  With box-graph routing the cook (actor 6, `alwaysZclip=1`) now walks a
  natural path (no longer the y=140 line) — user-confirmed 2026-06-05 — but
  the compositor still draws it behind the foreground table z-plane. So the
  remaining slice is a z-clip/compositor bug, *not* a routing one. Chase the
  cook's resolved clip plane vs. the table band (y≈102–122); see
  [ZPLANE](docs/SCUMM-V5-ZPLANE.md).

### Tier-2 divergence checklist

Silent, self-flagged approximations (run `git grep -nE "for now|doesn't yet|best-effort|we don't yet"`
to refresh). Tiering: **Tier 1** = loud (halts on unknown opcode — fine). **Tier 2**
= these (silent until a script ordering makes them observable, like the EXCD bug).
**Tier 3** = unknown unknowns (only ScummVM differential tracing finds them).

Priority H/M/L = likelihood of biting current/near play × severity.

- [ ] **M — dialog/string escape codes still deferred**
  (`decodeScummString` / `expandSubstitution`, `opcodes/index.ts:~2155`):
  keep-text `0xFF02`, sound `0xFF09`, actor-name `0xFF0A`, mid-string colour
  `0xFF0E` (each consumed but emits nothing). Surfaces as blank/wrong text or
  missing inline colour in dialogue-heavy content. (Also in Stubbed opcodes
  below.) *Done since last review:* `0x04` int, `0x05` verb-name, `0x06`
  object/actor-name, `0x07` string-resource all expand now.
- [x] **M — actor names not stored** — DONE (7d3754f). `setActorName` (`0x0D`)
  now writes `actor.name`; `vm.objectName` resolves actor-or-object, actor
  first → [INPUT §6](docs/SCUMM-V5-INPUT.md). Persists across rooms + saves.
- [ ] **L/M — `print` `clipped` line-wrap bound not modelled** (`vm.ts:~524`).
  Long lines may overflow / mis-wrap vs the original's clip-X wrapping.
- [ ] **L — camera scroll "snap both for now"** (`opcodes/index.ts:~411`) +
  smooth `panCameraTo` (Open backlog). Gradual scroll over frames; no current
  scene validates it.
- [ ] **L — flashlight gfx not modelled** (`opcodes/index.ts:~577`, dark-room
  strip extent). Cosmetic; only the flashlight rooms.
- [ ] **? — `actorOps` subop `0x0f` treated as no-arg no-op "for now"**
  (`opcodes/index.ts:~1874`; seen in MI1 boot after setCostume, not in the
  wiki). Assess whether it affects behaviour or is genuinely inert.
- Already tracked elsewhere (cross-ref, not duplicated here): box-graph routing
  (Pathfinding backlog), `screenEffect` animation + `VAR_CURRENT_LIGHTS`
  darkening (Rendering backlog), `saveRestoreVerbs` subset (Watch-for), audio /
  `resourceRoutines` (Out of scope — Phase 11).

**Box-graph routing — LANDED (2026-06-05), replacing grid-A*-over-mask.** The
faithful SCUMM pathfinder: parse `BOXM` (per-box `(from,to,next)` triples,
`0xFF`-term, even-pad), follow it box-to-box (`getNextBox`), gate each
transition on the shared edge, clamp the target into its box
(`adjustXYToBeInBox`). Locked boxes (`0x80` overrides) excluded live per walk;
sealed routes stop at the furthest reachable box. Deleted `grid.ts` + `mask.ts`
+ `walkableMask` + `rebuildWalkableMask` (the call site swapped under it as
designed). The room-52→circus long route now threads its full 12-box chain;
the room-28 cook follows BOXM's sequence, not the y=140 line. New decode +
router → [PATHFINDING](docs/PATHFINDING.md) (full rewrite). **827 unit tests**
(grid/mask tests removed, boxgraph/boxm added), tsc clean, 16 integration beats.

*Walker-physics follow-up (deferred, see backlog + [PATHFINDING §9](docs/PATHFINDING.md)).*
`stepWalk` steps X/Y at independent speeds; SCUMM moves along the line
(`calcMovementFactor`). On thin diagonal connector boxes the actor drifts off
the box, and `getActorWalkBox` (re-derives box from position) then reports the
wrong box — which is why a *single* click can't cross room 52's high/low bridge
(local script 202 force-stops the ego in box 7 at x>200). The faithful play is
staged (descend to the low zone first), so the walkthrough stages it in short
hops — matching how a player clicks down, *not* a workaround. Full fix:
line-following walker + walk-box-as-state (SCUMM `_walkbox`).

**Room 52 high/low geometry (user-confirmed 2026-06-05):** right = high zone
(entry), left = low zone (tent); you can't walk straight, must descend first.
Local script 202 enforces it (stop if box 7 & x>200); scripts 201 (camera pan)
/ 203 (per-region stepDist) co-run.

**Watch for** (recurring failure modes in newly-reached content):

- Unimplemented opcodes → an unknown-opcode halt freezes the *whole* VM.
- Object states beyond the initial `DOBJ` seed (only initial owner/state/class
  is parsed). See [OBJECTS §7a](docs/SCUMM-V5-OBJECTS.md).
- `saveRestoreVerbs`: we render-skip archived verbs (a subset of SCUMM's
  per-verb `saveid` model); revisit if a scene re-creates a saved verb id.
  See [INPUT §6](docs/SCUMM-V5-INPUT.md).

**Tooling:** `scratch/dis.ts` (+ `SCAN grep=`) is the disassembler CLI — keep it
in sync with the executing opcode table (AGENTS.md).

### Open backlog

Deferred out of earlier phases; none block current play. Detail in the linked docs.

**Input / UI**

- **Two-object "Use X with Y" end-to-end** — *done*; A+B commit + `g110`
  preposition + faithful #100 sentence line all confirmed. **Give X to
  <actor>** (verb 4) — *now done too* (Fettucini circus: give the pot to a
  brother actor). Needed headless actor hit-testing (`prepareActorDraw` /
  `Vm.actorHitBounds` / testkit `actorPoint`) — see Current. [INPUT §5](docs/SCUMM-V5-INPUT.md).
- **Inventory scroll arrows** (verbs 208/209) for >8 items — needs a full
  inventory to exercise.

**Rendering**

- **Unify the render surface (Option 2 — the faithful end-state for the UI).**
  Today the room is one canvas (engine compositor) and the verb/inventory bar is
  a second, shell-painted canvas; input was bridged by feeding screen coords
  (Option 1, done). The faithful design is one 320×200 surface — room slice
  (rows 0–143) + verb panel (144–199) — composited by the engine with 1:1 coords,
  and the sentence line as engine verb #100 assembled from `0xFF NN` substitution
  codes. Eliminates the coordinate seam entirely. Take it on when a *render-side*
  reason appears (verb #100 codes, mid-string dialogue colours `0x0E`, the
  copy-protection wheel) — not speculatively. Option 1 is a clean subset of it.
- **Compositor honours `VAR_CURRENT_LIGHTS`** — darken a night room via the
  lights flag, not only a dark palette (may be subtle; night rooms already ship
  dark palettes — check it's visible first). [LIGHTING §4](docs/SCUMM-V5-LIGHTING.md).
- **`screenEffect` transition animation** — state is modelled; the
  dissolve/scroll/instant *animation* is deferred (intro is all instant cuts).
  [SCREEN-EFFECT](docs/SCUMM-V5-SCREEN-EFFECT.md).
- **Smooth `panCameraTo`** — snaps today; no intro-reachable scene uses it, so
  the pan rate has no validation target. Wire it when a scene surfaces.

**Pathfinding**

- **Box-graph routing — DONE (2026-06-05).** BOXM-driven box-to-box routing
  replaced grid-A*-over-mask; see Current + [PATHFINDING](docs/PATHFINDING.md).
- **Line-following walker (`calcMovementFactor`) + walk-box-as-state — the
  faithful follow-up, deferred.** `stepWalk` steps X/Y independently; SCUMM
  moves along the line, and tracks the actor's box as walk state (`_walkbox`)
  rather than re-deriving it from pixel position. Without this, thin diagonal
  connector boxes are fragile (actor drifts off; `getActorWalkBox` mis-reports)
  — the room-52 single-click bridge crossing is the live symptom (staged in the
  walkthrough). Touches every walk + the stepWalk unit tests (which encode the
  current independent-step behaviour) → re-verify intro/bar/kitchen + render.
  [PATHFINDING §9](docs/PATHFINDING.md).

**Stubbed opcodes (cosmetic / peripheral)**

- `roomOps`: `shakeOn`/`shakeOff`, `roomIntensity` / `setRGBRoomIntensity`,
  `saveString` / `loadString`.
- `cursorCommand` image subops (0x2C): `setCursorImage` / `setCursorHotspot` /
  `setCursor`.
- `matrixOp` (0x30): box connectivity flags / scale / create-box-matrix.
- Dialog escape codes still deferred: keep-text `0x02`, sound `0x09`, actor
  name `0x0A`, mid-string colour `0x0E`. (`0x04`–`0x07` now expand — see the
  Tier-2 entry above.)

**Tooling**

- `disasm.ts` drifts past a non-print opcode mis-size on some scripts (e.g.
  global #178 tail) — chase only if a task needs that script.

### Out of scope (their own phases)

- **Audio** — sound opcodes stay silent stubs (`isSoundRunning → 0` lets
  sound-waits fall through). Fixes the "Le tre prove" ~5 s sound-gated hold for
  free. → Phase 11.
- **Resource-heap management** — `resourceRoutines` stay no-ops (resources load
  lazily; there's no managed heap to model).

---

## Next phases

One-liners; broken into tasks when we start them. See ARCHITECTURE.md §9.

- **Phase 11 — Audio.** iMUSE + AdLib first; MT-32 and CD redbook later.
- **Phase 12 — MI2 + polish.**

---

## Done

- **Phase 10 — Shell rebuild + EngineSession** *(2026-05-31)*. Rebuilt the shell
  around an `EngineSession` seam (engine owns the loop, clock injected →
  Node-testable) with a multi-page static build (`/`, `/explore`, `/play`); split
  the resource browser into a standalone Explorer and rebuilt the Player as a
  camera-driven canvas + always-on Debug panel; deleted both shell god-objects.
  See [ENGINE-SESSION](docs/ENGINE-SESSION.md) + ARCHITECTURE.md §4/§7.
  Engine composition + natural-play fixes landed alongside (sessions 8–11, all
  engine-faithful, user-confirmed): actor + box/`SCAL` scaling, ego box-mask
  z-occlusion, camera-follow ordering, and the SCUMM-Bar / pirate-dialog blocker
  fixes (chainScript, drawObject subop/state/eviction, room-change script stop,
  pseudo-room fallback, archived-verb render skip, DOBJ seeding + Untouchable
  class). Semantics in OPCODES / OBJECTS / ROOM / ZPLANE / CUTSCENES / INPUT.

- **Phase 9 — Save states** *(2026-05-31)*. Full live-VM snapshot/restore to a
  versioned JSON blob (typed arrays base64); bytecode/rooms/costumes reload from
  the game files. Per-game localStorage slots + file export/import; the real-MI1
  round-trip is byte-identical. Confirmed in-app.

- **Phase 8 — Polish** *(2026-05-31)*. Closed the gap from "runs without halting"
  to "behaves like the original" for the first rooms: z-plane occlusion,
  jiffy/frame pacing, the magenta UI palette + sentence-line-as-verb-#100,
  costume-anim head tracking. Remaining cosmetic stubs are in Open backlog above.

- **Phase 7 — Verb UI + input** *(2026-05-30)*. MI1 interactively playable boot →
  intro → first room via the original's own scripts (hover poller → verb-input
  script → sentence script; cutscenes; room lighting; inventory-as-verbs). See
  [INPUT](docs/SCUMM-V5-INPUT.md), [CUTSCENES](docs/SCUMM-V5-CUTSCENES.md),
  [BOOT](docs/SCUMM-V5-BOOT.md).

- **Phase 6 — Enough engine to walk** *(2026-05-28)*. 30+ opcodes, room/costume/
  object loaders, 13-slot actor table, pathfinding (A* over the walkable mask),
  frame compositor with z-planes, rAF main loop. Boot dispatches 3500+ opcodes
  into the title-screen idle. (Costume-anim decoder was still a known-bad spike
  here; solved in Phase 7 — see [COSTUME-ANIM](docs/SCUMM-V5-COSTUME-ANIM.md).)

- **Phase 5 — VM skeleton** *(2026-05-27)*. SCUMM v5 bytecode interpreter
  end-to-end at the structural level: index/LOFF/script loaders, var banks, 25
  cooperative slots, an opcode dispatch table (seed set), halt-as-first-class-state,
  and a VM inspector. See [INDEX](docs/SCUMM-V5-INDEX.md),
  [OPCODES](docs/SCUMM-V5-OPCODES.md).

- **Phase 4 — Text** *(2026-05-26)*. `CHAR` bitmap-font decoder at 1 and 2 bpp +
  a string → indexed-buffer renderer; charset inspector. See
  [CHAR](docs/SCUMM-V5-CHAR.md).

- **Phase 3 — Costumes** *(2026-05-26)*. Costume decode end-to-end (sub-palette,
  image tables, RLE frames) + z-plane occlusion masks + an actor compositor. See
  [COST](docs/SCUMM-V5-COST.md), [ZPLANE](docs/SCUMM-V5-ZPLANE.md).

- **Phase 2 — First pixels** *(2026-05-26)*. Room palette + background bitmap
  decode (full SMAP method dispatch) rendered on Canvas2D with TRNS transparency.
  See [SMAP](docs/SCUMM-V5-SMAP.md).

- **Phase 1 — Resource catalog** *(2026-05-25)*. Parse MONKEY.000/.001:
  XOR-decrypt (key 0x69), recursive block-tree walk, indented tree dump with a
  tag-description catalog.

- **Phase 0 — Scaffold** *(2026-05-25)*. Vite + TS + Vitest; library / install /
  player screens; game detection; IndexedDB handle persistence; browser-support
  gate.
