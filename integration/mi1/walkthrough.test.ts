/**
 * MI1 FULL WALKTHROUGH — the regression net.
 *
 * ONE continuous run: a single VM, booted once, driven through the game's own
 * solution from the title screen onward, state carrying forward the whole way.
 * We grow it room by room; the last green beat is the **frontier** — how far
 * the engine currently gets. Run it at the end of a session / after a refactor:
 * if the game stopped being playable anywhere, the failing beat's name says
 * where.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COVERS — and what it doesn't:
 *   • It is HEADLESS. It drives the VM and asserts on observable VM *state*
 *     (current room, object ownership, globals/bit-vars, halt, actor
 *     position, dialog text-as-data). It renders ZERO pixels.
 *   • So it catches LOGIC / PLAYABILITY regressions ("the door won't open",
 *     "the trial flag stops setting", "a script halts", "ego can't path").
 *     It does NOT catch visual ones — garbled compositing, z-order, a missing
 *     cursor — those stay the domain of in-browser real-pixel confirmation.
 *     A green run proves the game *plays*, never that it *renders*.
 *
 * RULES (same as the rest of the suite):
 *   • Drive from boot every run — no save fast-forward — so intro/early-room
 *     regressions can't hide. It gets slower as it spans the game; that's the
 *     price of honest coverage.
 *   • Deterministic: boot seeds the engine RNG ({@link SEED}) so the run is
 *     reproducible — a flaky regression net is worthless.
 *   • Assert MECHANICS via numeric ids, never localized strings. Where text
 *     must be checked, derive it from this build (e.g. a dialog answer's own
 *     `name`).
 *   • Player actions go through the faithful click flow ({@link actions});
 *     any unavoidable shortcut is flagged as debt at the call site.
 *
 * Data-gated (skipped without the game files). Run: `npm run test:integration`.
